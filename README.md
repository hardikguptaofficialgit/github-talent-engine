Made for the Konverge Hackathon.

This platform helps students and early career professionals get hired based on their contributions on GitHub. It analyzes their repositories, commits, pull requests, and overall activity to showcase real skills instead of relying only on resumes.

Users can discover relevant job opportunities, apply directly through the platform, and track their applications in one place.
